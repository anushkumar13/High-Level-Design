# High-Level Design (System Design Interview - Alex Xu)

This repository documents my complete learning journey through the book **"System Design Interview – An Insider's Guide"** by **Alex Xu**.

The goal is simple: understand how real-world scalable systems are built — not just from a theoretical view, but from a practical, interview-focused mindset.

## Why This?

System design interviews are hard. Most students ignore them until the very end. I'm taking a different path — building a solid foundation now, early in my career.

This repo will be a living proof of that learning.

## How to Read This Repo

Start from the basics. Don’t jump into system designs unless you're clear on:
- Latency vs Throughput
- Load balancer vs API Gateway
- SQL vs NoSQL
- CAP theorem
- Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
- CDN, Cache, Consistent Hashing

Once that’s solid, deep dive into individual systems.
